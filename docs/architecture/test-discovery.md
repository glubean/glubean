# Test Discovery Architecture

> Status: **Complete** — all phases (P0–P3) implemented  
> Last updated: 2025-02-17

## Problem

Test discovery (finding which tests exist, their IDs, tags, and metadata) is
implemented **7 separate times** across the Glubean ecosystem. These
implementations vary in capability, leading to inconsistent behavior:

1. **Missing export shapes:** MCP fails to discover `test.each`, `test.pick`,
   and builder-without-`.build()` tests entirely.
2. **ID/exportName routing bug:** MCP passes `exportName` (e.g. `"listUsers"`)
   where the runner expects `meta.id` (e.g. `"list-users"`), causing "Test not
   found" failures for any test where `id !== exportName` — including plain
   simple tests.

## Three Discovery Methods

Every consumer of test metadata falls into one of three categories:

| Method | How it works | Accuracy | Cost | Use when |
|--------|-------------|----------|------|----------|
| **Static** | Regex scan of source code | Template IDs only; no row expansion | Zero side effects, fast | IDE features, file indexing, quick preview |
| **Runtime** | Import module + resolve exports | Exact IDs, expanded rows, actual `Test` objects | Executes module top-level code | Local execution, precise discovery |
| **Metadata** | Read pre-generated `metadata.json` | Matches the scan that generated it | Offline, no execution | Cloud worker, server, CI bundles |

## Implementations (pre-consolidation snapshot)

> The descriptions below capture each implementation's state **before** the
> P0–P3 migration. See the Migration Plan section for what changed.

### 1. Scanner — `extractWithDeno` (Runtime, subprocess)

**Location:** `packages/scanner/extractor-deno.ts`  
**Used by:** `glubean scan`, `glubean sync`, `glubean context`, `glubean coverage`

Spawns a Deno subprocess, imports the test module, resolves all export shapes,
and reads the SDK global registry as a fallback.

| Capability | Supported |
|-----------|-----------|
| Plain `Test` | Yes |
| `Test[]` (test.each simple) | Yes |
| `TestBuilder` (no `.build()`) | Yes (via registry) |
| `EachBuilder` | Yes (calls `.build()`) |
| SDK registry fallback | Yes |

**Verdict:** Most complete runtime extractor. Canonical for directory-level scanning.

### 2. Scanner — `extractFromSource` (Static, regex)

**Location:** `packages/scanner/extractor-static.ts`  
**Used by:** MCP `list_test_files` / `get_metadata(static)`, Node scanner

Pure-function regex extraction. No imports, no side effects. Produces one
`ExportMeta` per export with template IDs (e.g. `get-item-$id`, not expanded
per row).

| Capability | Supported |
|-----------|-----------|
| `test("id", fn)` | Yes |
| `test({ id, name, tags }, fn)` | Yes |
| `test("id").step(...)` | Yes (extracts steps) |
| `test.each(data)("id-$key", fn)` | Yes (template ID) |
| `test.pick(examples)("id-$_pick", fn)` | Yes (template ID) |

**Verdict:** Best static extractor. Should be the single source for all
regex-based discovery.

### 3. Runner — `harness.ts` (Runtime, in-process)

**Location:** `packages/runner/harness.ts` (private functions)  
**Used by:** Runner subprocess (test execution)

Runs inside the sandboxed subprocess. Imports the user module and resolves
exports to find a specific test by ID. Contains complete resolution logic:
`isTestBuilder`, `isEachBuilder`, `autoResolve`, `findNewTest`,
`findNewTestByExport`.

| Capability | Supported |
|-----------|-----------|
| All export shapes | Yes |
| Find by test ID | Yes |
| Find by export name (fallback) | Yes |
| Auto-build builders | Yes |

**Verdict (before P0):** Complete but locked inside `harness.ts` as private
functions. Extracted to `packages/runner/resolve.ts` in P0.

### 4. CLI — `commands/run.ts` (Runtime, subprocess)

**Location:** `packages/cli/commands/run.ts:274-389`  
**Used by:** `glubean run`

Independent subprocess-based discovery with its own `isTest`, `isBuilder`,
`isEachBuilder`. Accesses private fields (`_meta`, `_baseMeta`, `_table`) to
read EachBuilder metadata without calling `.build()`.

| Capability | Supported |
|-----------|-----------|
| All export shapes | Yes |
| EachBuilder row expansion | Yes (reads `_table` directly) |
| Builder metadata | Yes (reads `_meta`) |

**Verdict (before P1):** Worked but was a redundant reimplementation. Migrated
to scanner's `extractWithDeno` in P1.

### 5. MCP — `mod.ts` (Runtime, in-process) — fixed in P0

**Location:** `packages/mcp/mod.ts`  
**Used by:** `glubean_discover_tests`, `glubean_run_local_file`

**Before P0:** In-process import with a primitive `isTest()` that only
recognized plain `Test` objects. `run_local_file` passed `exportName` as the
`testId` argument, but the runner matches by `meta.id`. When
`id !== exportName`, the test was not found.

| Capability | Before P0 | After P0 |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Plain `Test` (id === exportName) | Yes | Yes |
| Plain `Test` (id !== exportName) | **No** | Yes |
| `Test[]` (test.each simple) | **No** | Yes |
| `TestBuilder` (no `.build()`) | **No** | Yes |
| `EachBuilder` | **No** | Yes |

**After P0:** Replaced `isTest`/`discoverTestsFromFile` with runner's
`resolveModuleTests`. Routing now uses `test.id` (primary) with `exportName`
fallback.

### 6. VSCode — `src/parser.ts` (Static, regex)

**Location:** `vscode/src/parser.ts` (separate repo)  
**Used by:** Test Explorer, CodeLens, Trace CodeLens

Fork of scanner's `extractor-static.ts`, adapted for VSCode. Maintained
independently — will diverge over time.

| Capability | Supported |
|-----------|-----------|
| Same patterns as scanner static | Yes (at time of fork) |
| `test.pick` example extraction | Yes (extended beyond scanner) |

**Verdict (before P2):** Worked but was a fork. Migrated to
`@glubean/scanner/static` in P2.

### 7. glubean-v1 — `packages/shared/src/scanner.ts` (Static, regex) — removed in P3

**Location:** `glubean-v1/packages/shared/src/scanner.ts`  
**Used by:** Nothing (server reads `metadata.json`, not source)

Legacy static extractor using old `testCase`/`testSuite` schema. Not aligned
with current `test()` API.

**Verdict:** Dead code. Removed in P3.

### Non-discovery consumers (Metadata readers)

| Consumer | Location | Method |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Worker** | `packages/worker/executor.ts` | Reads `metadata.json` from bundle, `selectTests()` filters by ID/tag |
| **Cloud server** | `glubean-v1/apps/server/` | Reads `metadata.json` from bundle upload, stores in MongoDB |

These are correct by design — they consume metadata generated upstream by the
scanner.

## Target Architecture

Three authoritative sources, zero duplication:

```
@glubean/scanner
├── extractFromSource()     ← Static (regex, pure function)
│   Used by: VSCode, MCP list_test_files, MCP get_metadata(static)
│
├── extractWithDeno()       ← Runtime (subprocess, most accurate)
│   Used by: CLI scan/sync/context/coverage, CLI run (P1 migration)
│
└── types.ts                ← Shared types (ExportMeta, FileMeta, etc.)

@glubean/runner
└── resolve.ts (NEW)        ← Runtime (in-process, for execution context)
    ├── resolveModuleTests()  — enumerate all tests from imported module
    ├── findTestById()        — find specific test by meta.id (primary)
    └── findTestByExport()    — find test by export name (fallback)
    Used by: Runner harness, MCP discover_tests/run_local_file
    Contract: resolveModuleTests returns { exportName, id, ... } —
              consumers MUST use id for routing, exportName for display

metadata.json               ← Offline (pre-generated)
    Used by: Worker, Cloud server
```

### Scanner subpath exports (enables VSCode consumption)

```jsonc
// packages/scanner/deno.json
{
  "exports": {
    ".": "./mod.ts",           // Full scanner (Deno-only)
    "./static": "./static.ts"  // Pure function (any runtime)
  }
}
```

This allows the VSCode extension (Node.js + esbuild) to:
```typescript
import { extractFromSource } from "@glubean/scanner/static";
```
without pulling in Deno-specific modules.

## Migration Plan

### P0: Fix MCP discovery and routing — DONE

**Problems:**
1. MCP `discover_tests` and `run_local_file` miss all `test.each`, `test.pick`,
   and builder exports (broken `isTest()` only recognizes plain `Test`).
2. MCP passes `exportName` as `testId` to the runner, causing "Test not found"
   for any test where `id !== exportName` — including simple tests.
3. Minor: Windows path bug, secrets pairing, silent zero-test "success".

**Solution:** Extract runner's resolution logic into `packages/runner/resolve.ts`,
export `resolveModuleTests` from `@glubean/runner`, replace MCP's broken
`isTest()`/`discoverTestsFromFile()`. Fix test routing to pass `test.id` as
`testId` and `test.exportName` via the `exportName` option.

**Files changed:**
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/runner/resolve.ts` | **New** — extracted resolution logic |
| `packages/runner/resolve_test.ts` | **New** — contract tests (see below) |
| `packages/runner/harness.ts` | Import from `./resolve.ts` instead of private functions |
| `packages/runner/mod.ts` | Export `resolveModuleTests`, `ResolvedTest` |
| `packages/mcp/mod.ts` | Delete `isTest`/`isRecord`/`discoverTestsFromFile`, use runner's `resolveModuleTests`; fix test routing |

**MCP routing fix:**
```typescript
// Before (broken): passes exportName where runner expects meta.id
executor.run(fileUrl, test.exportName, { vars, secrets })

// After: passes actual test ID, with exportName as fallback
executor.run(fileUrl, test.id, { vars, secrets }, { exportName: test.exportName })
```

**Additional MCP fixes (same PR):**
- `findProjectRoot`: fix Windows infinite loop (`while (dir !== "/")` → `dirname` check)
- `testDir`: replace `lastIndexOf("/")` with `dirname()`
- Secrets pairing: `.env.staging` → `.env.staging.secrets`
- Zero-test error: return explicit error when `summary.total === 0`

#### Contract tests (required for P0)

A shared test fixture file exercises all export shapes. The `resolve_test.ts`
test imports this fixture and asserts that `resolveModuleTests` produces the
expected set of test IDs.

**Fixture covers:**
| Shape | Export example | Expected ID(s) |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Simple test (`id === exportName`) | `export const health = test("health", fn)` | `"health"` |
| Simple test (`id !== exportName`) | `export const listUsers = test({ id: "list-users" }, fn)` | `"list-users"` |
| Builder (no `.build()`) | `export const flow = test("flow").step(...)` | `"flow"` |
| Builder (with `.build()`) | `export const flow2 = test("flow2").step(...).build()` | `"flow2"` |
| `test.each` (simple mode) | `export const items = test.each(data)("item-$id", fn)` | `"item-1"`, `"item-2"`, ... |
| `test.each` (builder mode) | `export const items2 = test.each(data)("item2-$id").step(...)` | `"item2-1"`, `"item2-2"`, ... |
| `test.pick` | `export const pick = test.pick(examples)("p-$_pick", fn)` | `"p-<selected>"` |
| `only` flag | `export const onlyTest = test({ id: "only", only: true }, fn)` | `"only"` with `only: true` |
| `skip` flag | `export const skipTest = test({ id: "skip", skip: true }, fn)` | `"skip"` with `skip: true` |

This same fixture can later be reused by scanner and MCP tests to verify
cross-package semantic consistency.

### P1: Deduplicate CLI `run.ts` discovery — DONE

**Problem:** CLI had a ~100-line inline subprocess discovery script with
`isTest`, `isBuilder`, `isEachBuilder` that duplicated scanner's
`extractWithDeno`. The Map-keyed-by-`exportName` return type silently
dropped all but the last test for `test.each`.

**Solution:** Extended `ExportMeta` with `skip`/`only` fields, wrote
alignment contract tests for `extractWithDeno` against the shared all-shapes
fixture (13 tests), then replaced `discoverTests()` with a thin adapter
calling `extractWithDeno()`. Changed return from `Map<exportName>` to array,
fixing the test.each data loss bug.

**Files changed:**
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/scanner/types.ts` | Added `skip?` and `only?` to `ExportMeta` |
| `packages/scanner/extractor-deno.ts` | Populated `skip`/`only` in subprocess script |
| `packages/scanner/extractor-deno_test.ts` | **New** — 13 contract tests |
| `packages/cli/commands/run.ts` | Replaced 100-line inline script with `extractWithDeno` adapter |

### P2: VSCode imports from scanner (cross-repo) — DONE

**Problem:** `vscode/src/parser.ts` is a fork of `extractor-static.ts` that
will diverge.

**Solution:**
1. Add `"./static"` subpath export to scanner's `deno.json`
2. Publish scanner to JSR
3. VSCode installs via `npx jsr add @glubean/scanner`
4. Replace `parser.ts` regex with `import { extractFromSource } from "@glubean/scanner/static"`

**Changes:**

| File (OSS repo) | Change |
|------|--------|
| `packages/scanner/types.ts` | Added `variant?: "each" \| "pick"` to `ExportMeta` |
| `packages/scanner/extractor-static.ts` | Added `isGlubeanFile()`, populated `variant` in `parseTestDeclaration` |
| `packages/scanner/static.ts` | **New** — Deno-free entry point re-exporting static analysis API |
| `packages/scanner/deno.json` | Added `"./static"` subpath export, bumped to 0.11.0 |
| `packages/scanner/mod.ts` | Re-exported `isGlubeanFile` from main entry |
| `packages/scanner/extractor-static_test.ts` | Added 12 tests for `isGlubeanFile` and `variant` |

| File (VSCode repo) | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/parser.ts` | Replaced ~250 lines of regex logic with `extractFromSource` + adapter |
| `src/parser.test.ts` | Updated "id-missing" test to match scanner behavior |
| `package.json` | Added `@glubean/scanner@^0.11.0` dependency |

**Note:** VSCode migration depends on scanner 0.11.0 being published to JSR.
Scanner changes are shippable independently. `extractPickExamples` remains
VSCode-local — it serves CodeLens and has no scanner equivalent.

### P3: Remove legacy glubean-v1 scanner — DONE

**Problem:** `glubean-v1/packages/shared/src/scanner.ts` used old
`testCase`/`testSuite` schema. Neither `extractFromSource()` nor
`hasGlubeanSdkImport()` were imported anywhere in the server or apps.
The server defines its own `ExportMeta`/`FileMeta`/`SuiteTestMeta` in
`apps/server/src/bundles/schemas/bundle.schema.ts`.

**Solution:** Deleted `packages/shared/src/scanner.ts` and removed
scanner re-exports from `packages/shared/src/index.ts`. Verified
`tsc --noEmit` clean (no scanner-related errors).

**Files changed:**
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `glubean-v1/packages/shared/src/scanner.ts` | **Deleted** — 334 lines of dead code |
| `glubean-v1/packages/shared/src/index.ts` | Removed scanner re-exports |

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-02-17 | Runner extracts `resolve.ts` instead of MCP using scanner | Runner does in-process resolution (needs `Test` objects for execution). Scanner's `extractWithDeno` spawns a subprocess and returns metadata only — wrong abstraction for MCP's `run_local_file`. |
| 2025-02-17 | Scanner adds subpath exports instead of new package | `extractFromSource` is already in scanner, just needs a Deno-free entry point. No need for a new package. |
| 2025-02-17 | Worker and server stay on `metadata.json` | They operate on pre-built bundles. Runtime discovery would be wasteful and insecure. |
| 2025-02-17 | P0 must include `id !== exportName` routing fix | The bug is not limited to data-driven tests — any test where the JS export name differs from the declared `id` fails silently. Fixing only `isTest` shapes without fixing routing would leave a critical hole. |
| 2025-02-17 | P0 must include cross-package contract tests | Without a shared fixture that scanner/runner/mcp all validate against, the "7 implementations" problem can regress after consolidation. Contract tests lock the semantic contract. |
| 2025-02-17 | P1 requires behavior-alignment tests before migration | CLI's `discoverTests()` may have subtle behavioral differences from scanner's `extractWithDeno()`. Testing both against the same fixtures before switching prevents silent regressions. |
| 2025-02-17 | P1 extends ExportMeta with skip/only instead of separate CLI type | CLI needs skip/only for filtering. Adding to ExportMeta is non-breaking and avoids a CLI-specific discovery type. Static extractors return undefined for these (cannot determine at parse time). |
| 2025-02-17 | P1 switches CLI discovery from Map to array | Old code keyed by exportName, silently dropping all but the last test.each row. Array preserves all entries and fixes the bug. |
| 2025-02-17 | P2 adds `variant` to ExportMeta instead of ID prefixes | VSCode needs to distinguish each/pick for routing. Adding `variant` to scanner types is neutral and informative. VSCode adapter applies `each:`/`pick:` prefixes from the field. Runtime extractor leaves it undefined — SDK uses same `EachBuilder` for both. |
| 2025-02-17 | P2 adds `isGlubeanFile` to scanner | SDK import detection is generic static analysis, belongs in the shared scanner, not forked in VSCode. |
| 2025-02-17 | P2 uses `typesVersions` for backward-compatible subpath types | VSCode tsconfig uses `moduleResolution: "node"` (classic). Classic resolution ignores `exports` in package.json. `typesVersions` provides the fallback path for type resolution. |
| 2025-02-17 | P2 keeps `extractPickExamples` in VSCode | CodeLens pick-key extraction is a VSCode UX concern. Moving it to scanner would add presentation logic to a data extraction package. Can be ported later if other consumers need it. |
| 2025-02-17 | P3 deletes shared scanner without migrating server | Server defines its own `ExportMeta`/`FileMeta`/`SuiteTestMeta` in `bundle.schema.ts` and has its own `extractExportMeta` in `builder.service.ts`. The shared scanner's functions (`extractFromSource`, `hasGlubeanSdkImport`) had zero imports across the entire codebase. |
