# Git & Publish Safety

## Git operations

Never run `git commit` or `git push` (or any variant) without first asking the user for explicit permission and receiving confirmation.

This applies to all situations, including:

- Committing staged changes
- Amending commits
- Pushing to any remote branch
- Force pushing
- Creating tags and pushing them

Always describe what will be committed/pushed and wait for a "yes" or equivalent confirmation before proceeding.

## Package publishing

Never run `deno publish`, `npm publish`, or any package publishing command without first:

1. Listing which packages will be published and their new versions
2. Asking the user for explicit permission
3. Receiving a clear "yes" or equivalent confirmation

This applies regardless of context — even if the user asked to "bump and publish", always pause before the actual publish step to confirm.
